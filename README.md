Hi there! 👋 I'm Đức Anh
I’m a master’s student at the University of Copenhagen, studying a unique program that combines Cognitive Science and AI. With a passion for creating practical AI solutions, I’ve worked on:

🤖 Vietnamese chatbot systems for low-resource languages.
🌟 Exploring new perspectives of cognitive science to enhance AI explainability.
🔍 Researching how to leverage knowledge graphs to mitigate hallucinations and enhance the trustworthiness of LLM systems.
I’m skilled in Python, ML model deployment, and cloud services, and I enjoy tackling challenges in low-resource NLP and multi-modal AI.

📫 Check out my work and let’s collaborate!
